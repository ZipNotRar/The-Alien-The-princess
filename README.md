# The Alien & The Princess
## The files presented here show the logic behind production of the 2D platformer "The Alien & The Princess":-

* The [**Map.json script**](Map.json) creates the game's environment specifying the coordinates of each tile used within the map based on the variables within the script.
* The [**index.html script**](index.html) initializes all the other scripts related to the game into a markup screen making this a "camera" for the player to view the game.
* Finally, the [**main.js script**](main.js) is responsible for creating & placing all the rules and mechanics of the game, and the gameplay loops themselves.

### Additionally, there are 2 Videoclips which will give you a run-through of what to expect in the game and the internal sections of each script.
